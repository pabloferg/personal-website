# My Personal Website

Using the skills I learn in COdecademy's Web Development course, I am creating a personal website where I can:

- introduce myself. 
- explain my background.
- offer help to people.
- post some content in a blog. 

I want this project to cover both front-end and back-end technologies. 

Still in early stages... so stay tunned!
